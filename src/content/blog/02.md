NOTE: IN DRAFT

This is in continuation of the blog i wrote earlier on [installing nixos on vps](https://quantinium.dev/blog/01). In this post we are gonna package the rust program and deploy it on the vps and configure nginx so that its accessible anywhere.

For demonstration purposes, i have created a simple backend which just reqwests [yerkee.com](http://yerkee.com/api/fortune) and sends fortune as json response.

```rust
// main.rs
use axum::{Router, response::Json, routing::get};
use reqwest::StatusCode;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Message {
    message: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Fortune {
    fortune: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(get_fortune));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();
    println!("Server running at: http://localhost:3000");
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn get_fortune() -> Result<Json<Message>, StatusCode> {
    let body = reqwest::get("http://yerkee.com/api/fortune")
        .await
        .map_err(|_| StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)?
        .json::<Fortune>()
        .await
        .map_err(|_| StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)?;

    Ok(Json(Message {
        message: body.fortune,
    }))
}
```

Now if you try <u>cargo build</u> it would give a build error due to openssl. During development these are fixed by creating dev environments and just exporting the needed the libraries. Similarly while building it we just export the needed libraries too. 

Push all the code to github and run this to get the commit hash of your repository as we are gonna build it from there.
```shell
$ nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/quantinium3/fortune-cookie.git --branch-name main
{
  "url": "https://github.com/quantinium3/fortune-cookie.git",
  "rev": "1518c312a13dc6593666b2d38c01f24e8719b2e6",
  #...
  "hash": "sha256-ehkM8XvKHysYVaH5xdleVsatCtSfUrWxOC/9ADakGbg=",
  #...
}
```

Create a <u>flake.nix</u> at the root of your repo
```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "Fortune cookie backend";

  inputs = {
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
        };
      in
      {
        packages.default = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
          pname = "fortune-cookie-${version}";
          version = "0.1.0";
          src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
            owner = "quantinium3";
            repo = "fortune-cookie";
            rev = "1518c312a13dc6593666b2d38c01f24e8719b2e6"; # replace with the rev we got earlier
            sha256 = "sha256-ehkM8XvKHysYVaH5xdleVsatCtSfUrWxOC/9ADakGbg="; # replace with the hash we got earlier
          };
          cargoLock = { lockFile = ./Cargo.lock; };
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [ openssl ];

          OPENSSL_DIR = "${pkgs.openssl.dev}";
          OPENSSL_LIB_DIR = "${pkgs.openssl.out}/lib";
        };
      });
}
```

In it we have two inputs `nixpkgs` and `flake-utils` to simplify creating flake output for various systems. Nix provides a builtin module to simplify creating rust packages using `buildRustPackage`. In it we have the following input
- pname - name of the package
- version - version of the current package
- src - we are gonna fetch the source code from github with the specific commit hash.
- cargoLock - lockfile generated by cargo 
- buildInputs - packages needed while building the package
- enviroment variables - we are specifying openssl path's during build time so ensure linking against openssl.

That's it. run `nix build` and it should output a symlink `result` and we can run the server using `./result/bin/fortune-cookie`.

Just commit and push stuff to whatever platform you store code on. For convenience I'll just go with github. For testing that we can use it as a flake run 

```shell
$ nix build github:quantinium3/fortune-cookie && ./result/bin/fortune-cookie
Server running at: http://localhost:3000
```

We can use this package inside of our `flake.nix` but putting the input url as our github repo. 
```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.fortune-cookie.url =  "github:quantinium3/fortune-cookie";
```

In our configuration we can add this to install the server.
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.fortune-cookie.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
```

If we wanna run it automatically, we can setup a systemd process that can run and manage this binary
```nix
  systemd.services.fortune-cookie {
    description = "Fortune Cookie Backend";
    after = [ "network.target" ];
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    serviceConfig = {
      ExecStart = "${inputs.fortune-cookie.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/bin/fortune-cookie";
      Restart = "always";
      StandardOutput = "journal";
      StandardError = "journal";
    };
  };
```

After deploying, we can check the service status and also check if the service is running by doing a get request
```
$ deploy
$ ssh nixie curl http://localhost:3000 | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    61  100    61    0     0    117      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   117
{
  "message": "COBOL:\n\tAn exercise in Artificial Inelegance."
}
```

Now to point this to a domain we can use nginx as a reverse proxy to redirect the requests from the domain to our server running on localhost. Configure your dns provider, nginx and lets encrypt and now we can access this no a [domain](https://fortune.quantinium.dev)


```nix
  services.nginx = {
    enable = true;

    #... general nginx configuration 
    virtualHosts = {
      "fortune.quantinium.dev" = {
        enableACME = true;
        locations = {
          "/" = {
            proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:3000";
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };
```

We have deployed our rust server on our nixos vps successfully.

note for self: 
- add gh action
- add cachix
- explain some stuff
