This is a continuation of the blog post i wrote earlier on [installing and managing nixos vps](https://quantinium.dev/blog/01). In this post we are gonna package a rust webserver, deploy it on a vps and configure nginx so that its accessible from anywhere.

# Writing a Rust Web Server
For demonstration purposes, i have created a simple backend which just reqwests [yerkee.com](http://yerkee.com/api/fortune) and sends fortune as json response.

```rust
// main.rs
use axum::{Router, response::Json, routing::get};
use reqwest::StatusCode;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Message {
    message: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Fortune {
    fortune: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(get_fortune));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();
    println!("Server running at: http://localhost:3000");
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn get_fortune() -> Result<Json<Message>, StatusCode> {
    let body = reqwest::get("http://yerkee.com/api/fortune")
        .await
        .map_err(|_| StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)?
        .json::<Fortune>()
        .await
        .map_err(|_| StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)?;

    Ok(Json(Message {
        message: body.fortune,
    }))
}
```

Now if we run `cargo build` outside of nix environment, it may fail due to missing openssl dependencies as we are using `reqwest` crate. During development, we can create a `shell.nix` or `flake.nix` that create a reproducible dev environment that can handle locating various libraries and automatically configure environment variables. Similarly while building, we can include packages like `pkg-config` to locate openssl libraries declaratively.

Before packaging the webserver push the rust source code to any git hosting platform as we are going to fetch the source code from that repo. For convenience i'll just go with github.

# Packaging With Nix Flake
Prefetch the hash of the latest commit by running the following command. Nix references to fetch the code from that specific commit.
```shell
$ nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/quantinium3/fortune-cookie.git --branch-name main
{
  "url": "https://github.com/quantinium3/fortune-cookie.git",
  "rev": "1518c312a13dc6593666b2d38c01f24e8719b2e6",
  #...
  "hash": "sha256-ehkM8XvKHysYVaH5xdleVsatCtSfUrWxOC/9ADakGbg=",
  #...
}
```

Create a `flake.nix` at the root of our repo. In this flake we define things to successfully build our package
```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "Fortune cookie backend";

  inputs = {
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
        };
      in
      {
        packages.default = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
          pname = "fortune-cookie";
          version = "0.1.0";
          src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
            owner = "quantinium3";
            repo = "fortune-cookie";
            rev = "1518c312a13dc6593666b2d38c01f24e8719b2e6"; # replace with the rev we got earlier
            sha256 = "sha256-ehkM8XvKHysYVaH5xdleVsatCtSfUrWxOC/9ADakGbg="; # replace with the hash we got earlier
          };
          cargoLock = { lockFile = ./Cargo.lock; };
          nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ pkg-config ];
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [ openssl ];
        };
      });
}
```

The flake defines two inputs: `nixpkgs` - nix package collections and `flake-utils` - nix utility library that provides helpers like `eachDefaultSystem` to make sure our package builds for various systems.

Nix also provides a builtin function `buildRustPackage` which helps in building rust projects. In this function we provide the following attributes:
- `pname` - name of the package
- `version` - current version of the package
- `src` - the source code, which we fetch from github using a specific commit hash. You can refer to various fetchers [here](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-pkgs-fetchers)
- `cargoLock` - lockfile generated by cargo
- `nativeBuildInputs` - packages required during the build process but are not linked into the final binary. `pkg-config` is used to locate libraries like openssl.
- `buildInputs` - packages required during the build process and are linked into the final binary

That's it. Run `nix build` and it should output a symlink `result` dir which contains the compiled binary and we can run it using `./result/bin/fortune-cookie`.

Next, just commit and push the code to your repo, update the hash and rev in `flake.nix` and we can test if we can use it as a flake input.
```sh
$ nix build github:quantinium3/fortune-cookie && ./result/bin/fortune-cookie
Server running at: http://localhost:3000
```

# Deploying to VPS
Add the `fortune-cookie` repository as an input in our `flake.nix`
```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.fortune-cookie.url =  "github:quantinium3/fortune-cookie";
```
and include the package in system configuration.
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.fortune-cookie.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
```

To ensure that our backend service runs automatically, configure a systemd service 
```nix
  systemd.services.fortune-cookie {
    description = "Fortune Cookie Backend";
    after = [ "network.target" ];
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    serviceConfig = {
      ExecStart = "${inputs.fortune-cookie.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/bin/fortune-cookie";
      Restart = "always";
      StandardOutput = "journal";
      StandardError = "journal";
    };
  };
```

Now `deploy` and we are done. After it is successfully deployed we can test it by doing a `curl` request.
```
$ deploy
$ ssh nixie curl http://localhost:3000 | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    61  100    61    0     0    117      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   117
{
  "message": "COBOL:\n\tAn exercise in Artificial Inelegance."
}
```

To make our backend accessible worldwide via a domain, configure your domain to point to the vps ip address at your dns provider and configure [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) as reverse proxy so that all the requests to that domain will be routed to our running backend.We can now access our [domain](https://fortune.quantinium.dev/) worldwide.
```nix
  services.nginx = {
    enable = true;

    #... general nginx configuration 
    virtualHosts = {
      "fortune.quantinium.dev" = {
        enableACME = true;
        locations = {
          "/" = {
            proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:3000";
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };

  networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];
```

We have successfully deployed our rust server on our nixos vps successfully.

# Binary Caching with Cachix
[Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) is a service for hosting and sharing nix binaries. Instead of rebuilding the packages on every deployment or across multiple machines, we can push pre-built binaries to cachix cache and our systems can then download these binaries instead of rebuilding them.

Normally when we rebuild your system, nix checks if there is any change in the input's source code or dependencies and rebuild the package if there is a change but if no change happens it'll just reuse the package stored at `/nix/store` and not rebuild it again. For most part its fine as our system is not much changing but i wanted to include cachix here cause it's cool.

Since we have a github repo with the code and `flake.nix`, We can setup a github action that builds the package whenever we change the `flake.nix` or `flake.lock`. Why not build on push to main? In our `flake.nix` we have pinned the commit hash so in order to have a new binary we have update the commit hash and building everytime when main updates is just redundant.

To use the cachix cache we add the following to our configuration
```nix
  nix.settings.substituters = [ "https://quantinium3.cachix.org" ]; # your cachix cache
  nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ (builtins.readFile ../../secrets/keys/cachix_pub_key)  ]; # your cachix public key
```
and we can push the binary to cachix on every build using github actions.
```yaml
name: build and cache fortune
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'flake.nix'
      - 'flake.lock'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: install nix action
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v31

      - name: install cachix action
        uses: cachix/cachix-action@v15
        with:
          name: quantinium3
          authToken: "${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}"

      - name: build package
        run: nix build .#default

      - name: push to cachix
        run: cachix push quantinium3 ./result

      - name: trigger nixos deployment
        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN }}
          repository: quantinium3/nixie
          event-type: fortune_cookie_updated
```
This workflow:
- trigger on changes to `flake.nix` or `flake.lock`
- checks out repo, installs nix and cachix
- builds the package and push the resulting binaries with its dependencies to our cachix cache.
- dispatches an event to trigger deployment workflow in our server configuration repo.

To automate synching our configuration, we can use the following workflow which receives the event trigger from our upstream package (`fortune-cookie`)
```yaml
name: update flake.lock
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [ fortune_cookie_updated ]

concurrency:
  group: update-flake
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: install nix
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v31

      - name: update flake.lock
        run: nix flake lock --update-input fortune-cookie

      - name: verify update
        run: git diff --exit-code flake.lock || echo "flake.lock updated"

      - name: commit changes
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v6
        with:
          commit_message: "chore: update fortune-cookie input in flake.lock"
```
We can also have a second workflow that deploys our server configuration to our vps.
```yaml
name: deploy nixos configuration
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

concurrency:
  group: deploy-vps
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: install nix
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v31

      - name: setup cachix
        uses: cachix/cachix-action@v15
        with:
          name: quantinium3
          authToken: ${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}

      - name: setup ssh
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/nixie
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/nixie
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_CONFIG }}" > ~/.ssh/config
          chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS }}" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Deploy to VPS
        run: nix run github:serokell/deploy-rs
```

# Optional: Writing the config in `flake.nix`
Currently we are downloading the binary to our system and running the systemd service ourselves but this all can be abstracted to the flake and the user only has to import the flake and enable it as we generally do while configuring stuff.

We edit `flake.nix` to have the config options that install the package and runs is as a systemd service when we enable it in our configuration.

```nix
{
  description = "Fortune cookie backend";
  inputs = {
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
        };
        fortune-cookie = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
          pname = "fortune-cookie";
          version = "0.1.0";
          src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
            owner = "quantinium3";
            repo = "fortune-cookie";
            rev = "f9fb77497c01cfff0a68146f4cf4884e8ddf9145";
            sha256 = "sha256-mKVzDicZVDb7n/zFQ7Fx1t2IUd+pW/pIz/r5UlWcfSQ=";
          };
          cargoHash = "sha256-ASRlHxodqd2/6ZNzADCftrkJS8v6bonlyLI/RtjxGn0=";
          nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ pkg-config ];
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [ openssl ];
        };
      in
      {
        packages.default = fortune-cookie;
        packages.fortune-cookie = fortune-cookie;
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [ rustc cargo pkg-config openssl ];
        };
      }
    ) // {
      nixosModules.fortune-cookie = { config, pkgs, lib, ... }: {
        options.services.fortune-cookie = {
          enable = lib.mkEnableOption "Fortune Cookie Backend service";
        };
        config = lib.mkIf config.services.fortune-cookie.enable {
          systemd.services.fortune-cookie = {
            description = "Fortune Cookie Backend";
            after = [ "network.target" ];
            wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
            serviceConfig = {
              ExecStart = "${self.packages.${pkgs.system}.fortune-cookie}/bin/fortune-cookie";
              Restart = "always";
              RestartSec = "10s";
              StandardOutput = "journal";
              StandardError = "journal";
              User = "fortune-cookie";
              Group = "fortune-cookie";
              DynamicUser = true;
              NoNewPrivileges = true;
              PrivateTmp = true;
              ProtectSystem = "strict";
              ProtectHome = true;
            };
          };
        };
      };
    };
}
```
and we can change our configuration to only have one line to enable our backend.

```nix
  services.fortune-cookie = {
    enable = true;
  };
```
