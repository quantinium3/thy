My journey into the world of tech began with an urge to deploy a html page on my pc (pentium g3220). I had been wanting to switch to linux cause i was fed up with how bad and slow windows was after using it for 4mths and did install arch once on a wm. So thinking it as an opportunity of trying to install linux on bare metal and learning new stuff along the way like ssh, vim (i refused to use nano), nginx, ngrok and NAT, i successfully installed linux (5th try cause my drive was curropted) and deployed the page.

This marked the point of me starting to learn how things actually worked behind the scenes and was fascinated by it. This lead me down a deep rabbit hole of linux, windows managers, neovim and ricing and me nuking every windows system i touched. This was also around the time we were learning c at uni so i thought i'd shift to dwm (quit cause doing all that patching was a hassle) and then found xmonad which i daily drove for 1.5yrs.

After installing arch for about 15-20 times and making a guide for myself to remember all the commands to install arch, i wanted to learn something else. So i just started doing web development through odin project and was bored as hell so i just speedran through foundations part and dropped at full stack javascript and didnt do much for few months.

Now, after a few months, the dread came as i felt i was doing nothing and was being left behind. So to remove it, i wanted to learn a new lang and chose C++ because i started to hate javascript. I found this book - <a class="underline underline-offset-2" href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/">Exercises for Programmers</a> and started solving each question until i reached part 9 where we had to use external api's to do stuff. I had some idea how we did that cause of that half assed attempt to learn web development. Well in short i was angry as i couldnt find an easy library to fetch stuff and why firebase didnt support C++ and just used curl.h and nlohmann/json for json parsing.
